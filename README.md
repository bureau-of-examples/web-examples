Some useful JavaScript code I wrote for future reference.

1. How to set up a work copy:
 - Go to the parent folder where you want to create the project root folder in cmd;
 - Type in command:
git clone https://github.com/zhy2002/zcl.js.git

2. How to publish:
First edit the work copy
Stage changes with: git stage --all
Commit changes with: git commit -m "COMMENTS"
Push to github with: git push origin master
